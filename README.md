# Bachelorthesis - Epigenetic and transcriptional changes in relapsed pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
This repository contains a comprehensive R-based workflow for the analysis of RNA-Seq and WGBS methylation data, focusing on the comparison between diagnosis and relapse in patient samples. The project integrates differential expression analysis, PCA, enrichment analysis, and analysis of treatment-associated genes.

# Contents:
The analysis is organized into the following R Markdown files:

1. RNAseq Basic Analysis.Rmd:
  Performs the basic analysis of RNA-Seq data using DESeq2, including normalization, differential expression testing, and result export.

2. PCA for Expression.Rmd:
  Conducts principal component analysis (PCA) on gene expression data to identify patterns across sample groups.

3. Volcano Plots Expression.Rmd:
  Generates volcano plots to visualize differential gene expression (log2 fold change vs. adjusted p-value) across conditions.

4. Enrichment Analysis.Rmd:
  Runs Gene Ontology (GO) and/or Reactome enrichment analysis based on DE genes, using the clusterProfiler package.

5. PCA for DMRs.Rmd:
  Performs PCA on methylation data (differentially methylated regions), visualizing grouping based on diagnosis/relapse and age.

6. Methylation.Rmd:
  Analyzes DNA methylation data, identifies differentially methylated regions (DMRs), and links them to genes.

7. HeatMaps.Rmd:
  Creates expression and methylation-based heatmaps for selected genes or DMRs to highlight clustering and expression shifts.

8. Treatments with Volcano and Fisher.Rmd:
  Investigates gene correlations with treatment response and overlaps with DE genes using Fisherâ€™s Exact Test. Visualizes treatment-relevant gene sets via volcano plots.
